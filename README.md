## How to build it locally

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down the repository `git clone https://github.com/rdimitrov/rdimitrov.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes using `jekyll serve`
4. View the website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
